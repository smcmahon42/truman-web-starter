# Overview

This is a front-end starter kit for websites and apps based on Bourbon and Neat, utilizing Gulp for the build process.

## Technology

* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Front-end package management
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Streaming build system
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) - Lightweight mixin library for Sass
* [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) - Lightweight semantic grid framework for Sass and Bourbon
* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) - Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects

### Bower Packages

Bower packages are installed into the `_src/bower` folder. By default, the following packages are included as a reasonable starting point. Feel free to modify them for your project.

* `jquery`
* `bourbon`
* `neat`
* `normalize-scss`

Packages can added to `bower.json` and installed using `bower install --save-dev [package-name]`. See the [Bower website](http://bower.io/) for more details.
